# Microservices, Docker and Kubernetes

## Why Microservices?

1. An architectural pattern that is ready for Agile development
2. Introduces the philosophy of ‘Separation of Concerns’ in simple and complex domains
3. Acts as standalone systems or services which provides further benefits:
4. Reduces complexity and thereby easier testing in integration terms
5. Reduces risk by allowing deployment in chunks rather than the whole product for every small or big change
6. Due to their standalone nature, it allows flexibility for changing technology stack for one or more services, incremental upgradation and thus simpler maintenance
7. Microservices are loosely coupled vertical stacks thereby making it language independent
8. Ability to own your own data models and even allow flexibility for changing data stores

## Why Docker?

1. A popular evolving software with an excellent community support and built for microservices
2. Light weight when compared to VMs making it cost and resource effective
3. Provides consistency in environments irrespective of whether it is development or production environments
4. Enables continuous integration, delivery and deployment pipelines
5. Docker is not going anywhere, it provides integration with popular integration tools such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Ansible and lot more

## Why Kubernetes?

1. A strong infrastructure platform built with docker making it the industry standard for today
2. Provides features like auto scaling, load balancing, remote storage and service discovery like no other frameworks
3. Kubernetes is built such that it is not tightly coupled with one or more applications thereby making it a platform which lays down the foundation for any cloud native application
4. Built for scale and modularized management

## FAQs

> How do you manage complex products?

Manage is a fairly simple word as we all know that things are lot more complex when it comes to developing, deploying, upgrading and maintaining products. Some of the pestering problems of development that have existed over the past few years are determining effective methods to testing large products, deploying every small change to production, ensuring incremental upgradation of softwares and/or moving away from legacy systems. It is time we have a solution to our problems. Docker and Kubernetes to the rescue!

With the help of Microservices architecture, we can ensure separation of concerns, integration testing, standalone systems and services allowing incremental upgradation and loosely coupled vertical stacks with freedom to manipulate data making the product language or technology independent.

> Is it a dream to have consistent environment across development and production setup?

Not anymore! Docker allows you to eliminate the headaches and friction of building migration plans to the cloud. Infact, you can have an exact replica of production setup in your development mode thereby making it really simple to move things from dev to prod and vice versa any number of times.

> Do deployments give you nightmares? Can a small bug bring down your whole product?

Deployments have always been a nightmare in the past. This is due to the risk involved with it such as undetected bugs going to production, failures during deployment, application downtime and so on. With Docker and Kubernetes, one shall not worry anymore. These softwares are designed as infrastructure platforms providing features and integration tools for staging areas, isolated deployment of standalone services, backup and restoring facilities, zero application downtime and even continuous analytics and monitoring for your product. 

> Are every deployments manual even today?

Not anymore! Docker enables continuous integration, delivery and deployment pipelines for any application running anywhere on the cloud.

> Worried about scaling your product?

Not anymore! Kubernetes has become the industry standard that has laid the foundation for building any cloud native application with easy to scale capabilities. Some of the very obvious features provided by Kubernetes is auto scaling, load balancing, remote storage, service discovery and modularized management.
